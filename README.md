#### Pac man will learn how to beat a randomly generated stage by utilizing a heuristic search through the possible moves in the game.  The ghosts move according to the same rules as in the arcade game.  Their paths are predetermined by the way that pac-man moves, so their paths are the same every time pac-man repeats the game.
#
#### Pac-Man's heuristic for traversing the level is that he will always try to go in the direction that leads to the best point/movement ratio.

#### The randomly generated levels are different from the original pac-man game, so the ghosts will sometimes get stuck in a loop.  This can cause the game to be unwinnable.  In a case like this, just refresh the page and try a different level layout.
